	<p>Bellis perennis is grown as a tender biennial, English Daisy is a herbaceous perennial and has rhizomes (however, people in the northern United States grow this plant as an annual).
This plant likes sun with afternoon shade, prefers cool temperatures, as well as cool, moist, fertile soil. English Daisy often escapes from the flower garden into lawns, where it is considered a weed. This plant declines with summer heat and is not drought tolerant. This plant's seasons are spring to early summer with sporadic flowering till frost. This plant may be challenging to stop growing if grown in an ideal location. English Daisy likes heavy fertility. This plant reaches a mature height in a maximum of 5 years but can be as short of a time as 2 years. English Daisy is slow to start but then grows rapidly and can become weedy.
Fun Fact: Deriving from Latin roots, bellis means "pretty." 
Propagation: seed or division in spring; plant in fall
Insect, Diseases and Other Plant Problems: No major insect and disease problems. One pest is the European pepper moth whose host plant is the English Daisy (among other plants). This plant may have some problems with root-knot nematodes (galls) and rust.

	<p>Campanula americana, or American Bellflower, is an annual or biennial wildflower native to moist open woods, moist meadows, stream banks and ditches in shady areas of eastern North America  It is best grown in rich, moist, well-drained soils in part shade. They will tolerate more sun in cooler summer climates but prefer afternoon shade where summer climates are hot. This bellflower will readily reseed itself in the garden and is good for naturalizing. It is a pollinator magnet: many species of bees, wasps, butterflies, and hummingbirds will visit and search for nectar and pollen.
